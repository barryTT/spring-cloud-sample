# To use the default Spring Boot configured HTTP Basic security, just include Spring Security on the classpath (e.g. through spring-boot-starter-security).
# The default is a username of "user" and a randomly generated password, which isnâ€™t going to be very useful in practice,
# so we recommend you configure the password (via security.user.password) and encrypt it (see below for instructions on how to do that).
